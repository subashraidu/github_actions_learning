What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) platform built directly into GitHub.
It allows you to automate any part of your development lifecycle like
Running tests automatically on every push or pull request
Building and deploying code
Running scripts (linting, formatting, packaging, etc.)

Github action files are defined as YAML files located in the .github/workflow folder in your repo
You can multiple workflows in a repo triggered by different events

# components of git hub:

Component                         |  Description                                                               |  Example                    
----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------
Workflow                          |  The main YAML file that defines automation. Stored in.github/workflows/.  |  main.yml                   
Event                             |  Defines what triggers the workflow to run.                                |  on: push                   
Job                               |  A group of steps that run on the same runner.                             |  build,test,deploy          
Step                              |  A single task within a job. Can run commands or actions.                  |  run: npm test              
Action                            |  Prebuilt, reusable code that simplifies tasks.                            |  uses: actions/checkout@v5  
Runner                            |  The execution environment for the jobs (GitHub-hosted or self-hosted).    |  ubuntu-latest              
Environment Variables (Env Vars)  |  Configuration values accessible to steps.                                 |  env: VERSION: 1.0          
Secrets                           |  Secure, encrypted values used for credentials or tokens.                  |  ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}       
Artifacts                         |  Files saved from a job (e.g., logs, build outputs).                       |  Upload logs or test results
Cache                             |  Stores reusable dependencies to speed up builds.                          |  npm or pip cache           
Matrix                            |  Defines multiple job variants for testing across versions or OSes.        |  Node versions 14, 16, 18   


GitHub Actions workflows must be stored inside this specific folder:
.github/workflows/

GitHub does not scan other folders for workflows â€” only .yml or .yaml files inside .github/workflows/ are recognized as valid workflows.
